transform: rotate(90deg);
transform-orgigin: 100%;
transition: all 0.05s;
transition-timing-function: ease-in-out or cubic-bezier(0.1, 2.7, 0.58, 1);
 
#transform 
: The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.

#transform-orgigin
: The transform-origin property allows you to change the position of transformed elements.
2D transformations can change the x- and y-axis of an element. 3D transformations can also change the z-axis of an element.

#transition
: CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly (from one value to another), over a given duration.

#transition-timing-function
: specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
